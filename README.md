# Event Realm

**The project is not completely finished yet.**

It's a MERN application that will allow users to Create, Update, Delete and Share Events in their lives.

`UI`: React with:

- styled-components for styling
- react-router-dom for navigation
- framer-motion / react-transition-group for animations
- react-redux for managing theme & app state (will be using it for the whole app once I am finished with it).
- react-smooth-scroll handles the smooth transition between nav-links
- the UI is custom made and the themes were built in mind using only (light and dark mode)

`Database`: MongoDB with:

- MongoDB Atlas for storing the database in the cloud

`Server`: Node.js with:

- Express.js framework
- Mongoose

`TODO:`

- Authentication will be done via: - google auth - custom jwt login

- Frontend API requests will be implemented with Redux-toolkit / Redux-thunk
